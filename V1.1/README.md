# Welcome to TicTacToe, version 1.1!

This directory contains a 2D TicTacToe game using the pygame library that merges the two .py files in the root directory into one interface.
The user may choose which difficulty (random or algorithmic) they would like to play against.

The algorithm is the same as that used in the .\UnbeatableTTT.py file.
The file button.py originates from my PygameSnake repository file of the same name.

The file pygameTTT.py is the base for the entire project.
